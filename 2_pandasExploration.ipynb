Each row has a unique label (the `row index`), and each column has a unique label (the `column index`).\n","- Note that each column in a `DataFrame` can be considered a `Series` (`Series` index).\n","\n","> Behind the scenes, these datatypes use the NumPy (\"Numerical Python\") library. NumPy primarily adds the `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) datatype to Pandas. An `ndarray` is similar to a Python list — it stores ordered data. However, it differs in three respects:\n","> - Each element has the same datatype (typically fixed-size, e.g., a 32-bit integer).\n","> - Elements are stored contiguously (immediately after each other) in memory for fast retrieval.\n","> - The total size of an `ndarray` is fixed.\n","\n","> Storing `Series` and `DataFrame` data in `ndarray`s makes Pandas faster and uses less memory than standard Python datatypes. Many libraries (such as scikit-learn) accept `ndarray`s as input rather than Pandas datatypes, so we will frequently convert between them."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"xHRNiHVD_LL3"},"source":["### Using Pandas\n","\n","Pandas is frequently used in data science because it offers a large set of commonly used functions, is relatively fast, and has a large community. Because many data science libraries also use NumPy to manipulate data, you can easily transfer data between libraries (as we will often do in this class!).\n","\n","Pandas is a large library that typically takes a lot of practice to learn. It heavily overrides Python operators, resulting in odd-looking syntax. For example, given a `DataFrame` called `cars` which contains a column `mpg`, we might want to view all cars with mpg over 35. To do this, we might write: `cars[cars['mpg'] > 35]`.\n","\n","Do not be discouraged if Pandas feels overwhelming. Gradually, as you use it, you will become familiar with which methods to use and the \"Pandas way\" of thinking about and manipulating data."]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"2pM1R1QY-Al0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1612034470955,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":394,"user":{"displayName":"Bryce Macher","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgYnbOWp8hhlnYUVMl0XN90RfItmB3zl5wiAoK5=s64","userId":"00937975388320138090"}}},"source":["#Because it's not part of base python, we have to import pandas.
