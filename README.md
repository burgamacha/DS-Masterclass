<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The DS Masterclass

These materials are for my General Assembly Data Science masterclass. This is usually 6-8hrs in a weekend, and intended to get folks' feet wet with thinking about code+math. 

The masterclass uses Google collab to get around the annoying local install of Conda, etc. If you want to work through these resources on your own, you'll need to either download the Anaconda distribution or set up Collab in your google drive.
